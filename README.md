# Architecture Decision Records of the DLSS Infrastructure Team

This repository contains a running and evolving list of architecture decision records (ADRs), documenting architectural decisions made by the [DLSS Infrastructure Team](https://github.com/orgs/sul-dlss/teams/infrastructure-team). Architecture decisions pertain to practices, projects, policies, software, system architecture, and technology selection.

Current ADRs are listed in the sidebar to the left, numbered in sequential, chronological order.

## Process

For new ADRs, please copy [the MADR-based template](/infrastructure-adrs/template/) as your starting point and build out from there. (More information on the MADR (Markdown Architectural Decision Records) format is available at [https://adr.github.io/madr/](https://adr.github.io/madr/). General information about architectural decision records is available at [https://adr.github.io/](https://adr.github.io).)

New ADR proposals should be drafted as pull requests to [sul-dlss-labs/infrastructure-adrs](https://github.com/sul-dlss-labs/infrastructure-adrs), which will be reviewed and approved by the Infrastructure team (via a process that is not yet documented, but, once it is, will be linked here).

Once your pull request has been reviewed, approved, and merged into the `master` branch, GitHub will automatically trigger a Jekyll build and redeploy the site. You should see your changes within 1-2 minutes of the merge.

## Acknowledgments

Inspiration (and some text) for this site comes from the fine folks at [Artefactual Systems](https://www.artefactual.com/), specifically from their [Archivematica architectural decisions site](https://adr.archivematica.org/). Thanks, Artefactual!
